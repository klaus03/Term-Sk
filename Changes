0.16 - 2014-09-07T19:42:55+01:00

  [DOCUMENTATION]

  - Add a .gitignore file

  - Changelog dates are better written as YYYY.MM.DD and probably ordered in
    the other, descending, direction
    Remark: I have decided to follow the ISO 8601 standard at
    http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime

  - Just use a Makefile.PL and not a Build.PL the latter does not have any
    added value any more

  - In Makefile.PL ==> meta files link to repository

0.15 - 2014-08-17T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - Add a new sub tok_maybe(), which is similar to token(), except that
    tok_maybe() calls $self->show_maybe; whereas...
    token()     calls $self->show;

0.12 - 2012-12-08T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - make subroutine $sk->token() to display the progress immediately (replacing
    $self->show_maybe; by $self->show; inside the subroutine token)

0.11 - 2011-07-19T12:00:00+01:00

  [DOCUMENTATION]

  - update the documentation and give some examples to allow more than one token in a single line

0.10 - 2011-07-16T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - allow more than one token in a single line

0.09 - 2011-06-21T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - refactor/simplify subroutine rem_backspace().
    refactor/simplify time recording (subroutine show_maybe())
    in subroutine token(): replace $self->up; by $self->show_maybe;
    add some more tests
    add initialiser 'mock_tm' and method mock_time() to mock time for testing
    add configure_requires => { 'Module::Build' => 0.30 } to Build.PL

0.08 - 2011-05-14T12:00:00+01:00

  [DOCUMENTATION]

  - In the POD documentation, remove the "or die..." from "my $ctr = Term::Sk->new(...) or die..."
    Also, as suggested by Salvatore Bonaccorso, change the POD documentation as follows:
    before: This option allows to register...
    after : This option allows one to register...
    Make subs log_info(), set_chunk_size() and set_bkup_size() effectively dummy operations (i.e. they
    don't have any effect whatsoever)

0.07 - 2011-05-09T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - Introduce a new format character "%k" (="Token"). Idea and patch provided by Bruce Ravel.
    Token which updates its value before being displayed. An example use
    of this would be a loop wherein every step of the loop could be
    identified by a particular string.

0.06 - 2010-05-28T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - add option {num => q{9'999}} to allow variable number formats
    add dynamic growth of a number, such that format: '%c of %m' outputs
    2_870 of 9_274
    Also, write something reasonable in file README

0.05 - 2010-05-11T12:00:00+01:00

  [DOCUMENTATION]

  - in Build.PL and in Makefile.PL

0.04 - 2010-03-27T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - add a function rem_backspace() that takes a file and removes backspaces from that file

  [REVERT]

  - revert back to version 0.02 (except for "add Build.PL" and "make new() die on errors"), that is...
    * remove item from ver 0.03: "...add code to detect $ENV{TERM_SK_OUTPUT}..."
    * remove item from ver 0.03: "...add Sidenotes.pod..."
    * remove item from ver 0.03: "...add use IO::Handle and replace local $| = 1;..."

0.03 - 2010-01-22T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    make new() die on errors
    add "use IO::Handle" and replace "local $| = 1;" by "IO::Handle::flush();"

0.02 - 2009-11-24T12:00:00+01:00

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - make option {quiet => !-t STDOUT} the default
    make option {pdisp => '!'} meaningless, i.e. always use "#" to
    display the progress bar

0.01 - 2009-06-20T12:00:00+01:00
