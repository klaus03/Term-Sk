Revision history for Term-Sk

0.01 2009-06-20
 - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02 2009-11-24
 - make option {quiet => !-t STDOUT} the default
   make option {pdisp => '!'} meaningless, i.e. always use "#" to
     display the progress bar

0.03 2010-01-22
 - add code to detect $ENV{TERM_SK_OUTPUT} to connect to, in which case {quiet =>...} is ignored
   add Build.PL
   add Sidenotes.pod
   make new() die on errors
   add "use IO::Handle" and replace "local $| = 1;" by "IO::Handle::flush();"

0.04 2010-03-27
 - add a function rem_backspace() that takes a file and removes backspaces from that file
   revert back to version 0.02 (except for "add Build.PL" and "make new() die on errors"), that is...
   * remove item from ver 0.03: "...add code to detect $ENV{TERM_SK_OUTPUT}..."
   * remove item from ver 0.03: "...add Sidenotes.pod..."
   * remove item from ver 0.03: "...add use IO::Handle and replace local $| = 1;..."

0.05 2010-05-11
 - in Build.PL and in Makefile.PL
   change requirement "use 5.10" to the less restrictive "use 5.8"

0.06 2010-05-28
 - add option {num => q{9'999}} to allow variable number formats
   add dynamic growth of a number, such that format: '%c of %m' outputs
    2_870 of 9_274

   Also, write something reasonable in file README

0.07 2011-05-09
 - Introduce a new format character "%k" (="Token"). Idea and patch provided by Bruce Ravel.
   Token which updates its value before being displayed. An example use
   of this would be a loop wherein every step of the loop could be
   identified by a particular string.

0.08 2011-05-14
 - In the POD documentation, remove the "or die..." from "my $ctr = Term::Sk->new(...) or die..."
   Also, as suggested by Salvatore Bonaccorso, change the POD documentation as follows:
    before: This option allows to register...
    after : This option allows one to register...
   Make subs log_info(), set_chunk_size() and set_bkup_size() effectively dummy operations (i.e. they
   don't have any effect whatsoever)

0.09  2011-06-21
 - refactor/simplify subroutine rem_backspace().
   refactor/simplify time recording (subroutine show_maybe())
   in subroutine token(): replace $self->up; by $self->show_maybe;
   add some more tests
   add initialiser 'mock_tm' and method mock_time() to mock time for testing
   add configure_requires => { 'Module::Build' => 0.30 } to Build.PL

0.10 2011-07-16
 - allow more than one token in a single line

0.11 2011-07-19
 - update the documentation and give some examples to allow more than one token in a single line

0.12 2012-12-08
 - make subroutine $sk->token() to display the progress immediately (replacing
   $self->show_maybe; by $self->show; inside the subroutine token)

0.13 2012-012-30
 - Bug #82102 for Term-Sk: [PATCH] Small Spelling error in manpage (Wed, 19 Dec 2012 07:21:10 +0100)

   >> Hi In Debian we are currently applying the attached patch to Term-Sk. We thought you might be interested
   >> in it, too. Thanks in advance, Salvatore Bonaccorso, Debian Perl Group
   >> -counter must be instantiated with an in tial value for the token.
   >> +counter must be instantiated with an initial value for the token.

0.14 2013-05-19
 - Add a new sub tok_maybe(), which is similar to token(), except that
   tok_maybe() calls $self->show_maybe; whereas...
   token()     calls $self->show;

0.15 2014-08-17
 - Reformat changes files to comply with the format already used in Acme::Indent
   Also, make time token (%t) align right (and not left)
